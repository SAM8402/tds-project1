# GitHub Users and Repositories in Delhi

- Scraped data of GitHub users in Delhi with over 100 followers and their repositories using the GitHub API.
- Found an interesting distribution of programming languages used across repositories, with Python and JavaScript being the most popular.
- Developers should consider maintaining project documentation and wikis in their repositories to increase collaboration.

## Process
The code uses the GitHub API to search for users by location and filter them based on follower count. Each user's public information and repositories were scraped using their respective API endpoints.

## Interesting Findings
The most popular programming languages among these users were Python and JavaScript. Interestingly, only about 50% of users have a company listed in their profiles.

## Recommendations
For developers seeking to grow their GitHub presence, focusing on creating detailed documentation and using wikis to organize projects can enhance visibility and collaboration.
